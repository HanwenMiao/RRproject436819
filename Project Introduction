Code Reproduction Explanation
I have converted the original project’s Python code to R code. Due to Twitter’s delisting, there is no stock price information for Twitter on Yahoo Finance.
Therefore, the new investment portfolio consists of three companies, which may slightly affect the results.I also made another version which used 20 Polish stocks WIG20 to build and optimize the portfolio.
The code file called RRproject.Rmd. Actually I completed it first and then I did another one used the original stocks.
